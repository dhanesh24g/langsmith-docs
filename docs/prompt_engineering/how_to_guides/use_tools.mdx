# Use tools in a prompt

The LangSmith playground supports tools, which are functions that can be called by the model to perform tasks like searching the web, looking up information, and more.

## Add a tool

To add a tool to your prompt, click the `+ Tool` button at the bottom of the prompt editor.

## Construct a tool

To create a custom tool, you'll need to provide a name, description, and arguments. The arguments are the inputs to the tool.

Note that when running a custom defined tool in the playground, the model will respond with a JSON object containing the tool name and the tool call.
There's no current way to hook this up to a hosted tool via MCP.

## Use a built-in tool

Some model providers support calling tools directly. For example, OpenAI hosts a web search tool that can be used to search the web.
In the tool section, you can select the built-in tool you want to use.

If the model calls the tool, the playground will output the response from calling the tool.

## Tool choice

Some models support forcing a model to use a specific tool. To see the options for the model you're using, go into the prompt settings -> tool settings -> tool choice.

Each provider has different options, so check the provider's documentation for more information on how each one works.
